# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
Working alongside the chief Data Scientist from a local school district, I have been asked to create an analysis of school performance in the district, to enable a comparison between schools. This analysis will be used to inform future decision making at the school and district level regarding the school budgets. The school district analysis will consist of the following:

- A district summary
- A school summary
- A table showing the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- A comparison of the average math and reading scores for each grade level from each school
- A comparison of the school spending per student, by school size, and by school type

In addition, the school board has notified us that the student data file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, the reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to us for help. In order to ensure academic rigour, I will replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. I also will then repeat the school district analysis and describe how these changes have affected the overall analysis.
## Results
### District summary
At the total district level, the headline results were not affected by the removal of the Thomas High School (THS) 9th grade results. As you can see from the data tables below, the overall average results from the 15 schools in the district are identical.

### How is the school summary affected?
### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following?
#### Math and reading scores by grade

## Summary
There were a number of changes that were made to the overall analysis after removal of the reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School. I have highlighted the changes below.
